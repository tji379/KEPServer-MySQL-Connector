# KEPServer-MySQL-Connector
KEPServerEX itself does not support the direct transfer of data to a MySQL database. We write a Python script to import information from KEPServerEX into a MySQL database.  This Python script is primarily designed to periodically read data from a KEPServerEX OPC UA server and write this data into a MySQL database.
